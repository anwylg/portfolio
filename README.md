# Anwyl Gabutero
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of my work in cybersecurity, programming, and IT-related projects. From Python scripts and Linux-based solutions to security monitoring setups using SIEM tools like Splunk, I showcase my skills and passion for learning. I continuously update this portfolio as I expand my expertise and take on new challenges in the cybersecurity space. Feel free to explore my repositories to see how I tackle real-world problems and apply my knowledge to strengthen security and improve systems.

I recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Certification, where I gained hands-on experience in threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring. Building on this foundation, I am planning to study for and pass the CompTIA Security+ certification to further enhance my cybersecurity knowledge and skills. I am eager to apply my technical expertise to strengthen organizational security while continuing to grow professionally in the field.
